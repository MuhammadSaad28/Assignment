    <h2 id="ha">What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?</h2>
    <p>BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a numerical value that provides an indication of an individual's body fat
        based on their weight and height. The BMI formula is calculated as follows: <br>

        BMI = weight (in kilograms) / (height (in meters) * height (in meters))  <br>

        The resulting value is used to categorize individuals into different BMI ranges, which are commonly associated
        with different levels of body fatness and health risks. The standard BMI categories are as follows: <br>
<ul>
       <li> Underweight: BMI less than 18.5 </li>
       <li> Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 </li>
        <li> Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9 </li>
        <li>Obesity (Class I): BMI between 30 and 34.9 </li>
       <li> Obesity (Class II): BMI between 35 and 39.9 </li>
       <li> Obesity (Class III): BMI 40 or higher </li>

</ul>       
        It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it has limitations. It does not directly
        measure body fat percentage or account for differences in muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat.
        Therefore, it may not accurately reflect an individual's overall health status. It is always advisable to
        consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment of one's health.</p>

    <p>Pakistan defeated India by five wickets in their Asia Cup 2022 Super 4 match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, September 4.</p>
    <p>The two teams first met in 1952, when Pakistan toured India for a five-match Test series. The hosts won the series 2-1. Since then, both countries have engaged in several Test, ODI and T20I matches. </p>
    <p>However, due to the political tensions and multiple wars between the two nations, over the years, cricket suffered as both sides were ordered to abandon any cricketing ties with each other. </p>
    <p>India and Pakistan have locked horns on 203 occasions on the international level to date with Pakistan having a better head-to-head record over India in Tests and ODIs. </p>
